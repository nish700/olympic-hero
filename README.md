### Project Overview

 The Olympic events occurs in two different format namely , Summer and Winter . Some countries perform better in Summer Olympics while others in Winter one. While some maintain a consistant performance across both the formats. 

In this project we are going to identify the teams that perform well in one or the other format of the Olympics . We would also check if there is any team showing consistant performace.

Another way of measuring the performance could be measuring the number of Gold, Silver and Bronze won by the teams. Gold has higher recognition than Silver and Bronze. We would be assigning points to teams on the basis of their medal count and identify the Best Team from the data.

This involves applying python programming concepts :
   - DataFrame
   - List
   - Comprehension
   - Pandas 
   - etc to name a few
